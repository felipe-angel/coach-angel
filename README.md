# Coach Angel App

This Expo/React Native project is a lightweight prototype of the **Coach Angel** concept.
It showcases the free training programs and gates premium features behind a simple
boolean flag.

## Free Features
- Browse three core programs: Hypertrophy, Powerlifting and Cardio.
- View basic details for each program.

## Premium Features (stubbed)
When `IS_PREMIUM` in `lib/constants.js` is set to `true` the following screens
become accessible from the home screen:
- AI Chat Coach
- Custom Workout Planner
- Macro Calculator

These screens are placeholders and can be extended with real functionality.
